# Assesment Submission - Thomas Adams

##Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. In the cmd terminal run `npm install`
3. In the cmd terminal cd into the src directory and run in the cmd line `tsc index.ts`
4. run in cmd `node.js`

##Notes
1. I use js object reference utility in es6 to build the tree

##If I had More Time
1. I would provide more error checking for edge cases ie non sorted data and no employee found for now it works because the data is sorted and all test cases work
2. I would DRY the application there are some place code be reduced
3. Use more complex type for for arrays


##Bonus
1. The two fucntions with similar logic are getBoss and getSubordinates you could add a parameter to choose witch value you want
